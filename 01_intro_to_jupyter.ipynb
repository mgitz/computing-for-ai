    "## Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two main types of cells: **Markdown** and **Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown** cells allow you to use symbols that are then rendered into nicely formatted text, tables, images, etc. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) was created in 2004 as a plain text languge for generating formatted text that was itself readable in plain text. It is now widely used across many platforms. While there is a base standard, implementations can differ in some details. The official [Jupyter Notebook markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) documentation provides a good overview, but for the *Practicum AI* courses, mostly you will not need to create markdown, but it will be used to provide the explanatory information for you as you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To do\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Double click on this cell to see the raw Markdown text that is rendered to create the formatted text.**\n",
    "* **For Jupyter on an HPC**: \n",
    "   * When you are done, either click the play button in the top row, or type Shift-Enter on your keyboard.\n",
    "   ![Screenshot showing the play button in Jupyter to run code cells or render Markdown cells](images/Jupyter_play.png)\n",
    "* **For Google Colab**:\n",
    "   * Google Colab has a slightly different Markdown editor view that splits the screen. Markdown is shown on the left, and formatted text on the right. You can even use the text formatting tools on the right to auto-generate the markdown. Rather than using the play button to render Markdown, simply click out of the cell and the split will return to the rendered view.\n",
